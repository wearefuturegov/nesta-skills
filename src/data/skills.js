        content: `
            <p>You look beyond the usual suspects to engage a wide variety of citizens and stakeholders. You can find and engage with those affected by a project (whether that is directly or indirectly) and make them a vocal part of the project, from generating ideas to implementing them. </p>

            <p>Doing this well helps to ensure the suitability, fit and uptake of an approach as you’ve brought people along with you.</p>

            <p>In practice behaviour:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Seeing the people affected by an issue as experts in their own right too and including their voice.</li>
                <li>Listening to people’s everyday experiences and challenging your own assumptions.</li>
                <li>Tailoring activities for the people you’re working with and listening to a wide group of people, particularly those who aren’t often heard.</li>

        content: `
            <p>You’re aware that not everyone communicates the same way, and are creative in bringing the best out of people. You use different approaches to fit the people in the room.</p>

            <p>Creative facilitation looks different depending on who is doing it, but done well it produces similar outcomes; creative exploration of possibilities and the shared understanding or ownership of ideas. This could be through high energy workshops, meetings, events or conversations.</p>

        content: `
            <p>By reaching out and making new connections between different groups, you help stakeholders with different interests find common ground and orient them towards a
            shared goal.</p>

            <p>Stakeholders often have different aims around a single issue. Looking beyond these
            differences, spotting the similarities and aligning them to a common goal is the art of bridge building. That might mean translating the different perspectives and ideas of one group into terms another would understand. This is no doubt hard, but can create the trust necessary to focus on a shared goal.</p>
