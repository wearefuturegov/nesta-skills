You are financially savvy, and can use various financial mechanisms to support innovation processes or problem solving. This could be alternative ways of financing like R&D funding, impact bonds, challenges, crowdfunding or innovation grants (and others!).

This might look like a willingness to stand up and promote new ways of financing change. By challenging existing models of procurement or public spending, you create more possibilities with the resources available.
