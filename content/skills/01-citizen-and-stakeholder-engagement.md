You look beyond the usual suspects to engage a wide variety of citizens and stakeholders. You can find and engage with those affected by a project (whether that is directly or indirectly) and make them a vocal part of the project, from generating ideas to implementing them.

Doing this well helps to ensure the suitability, fit and uptake of an approach as you’ve brought people along with you.

In practice behaviour:

* Seeing the people affected by an issue as experts in their own right too and including their voice.
* Listening to people’s everyday experiences and challenging your own assumptions.
* Tailoring activities for the people you’re working with and listening to a wide group of people, particularly those who aren’t often heard.
