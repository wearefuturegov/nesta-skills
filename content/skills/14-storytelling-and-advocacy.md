You transform a vision, insight or data into stories that resonate with people. You make it easy for people to understand the experiences of others. This sparks ideas and questions in your audience around specific issues; getting them to think about a topic or problem in a new light.

You are also able to advocate for the use of new methods and approaches to challenge business as usual, translating their value into meaningful terms and articulating the value of doing something new.
