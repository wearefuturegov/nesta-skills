text: Being entrepreneurial within an organisation to create new opportunities
---
You question and challenge the status quo and create opportunities for change within an organisation. You take calculated risks to develop and embed new ideas and business models for the benefit of an organisation and those it serves. You are entrepreneurial within an organisation - hence ‘intrapreneurship’.

Intrapreneurship is bold, and needs people to put their neck on the line to challenge existing situations. Success might look like ‘risky actions’ to some, but seeks high level change in the way an organisation operates.
