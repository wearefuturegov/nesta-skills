You are able to look beyond immediate issues to develop a long-term vision. You are comfortable exploring many possible future scenarios and experimenting with ways to deal with them. This drives the desired change you want to see and informs the short-term tasks that get you there. This skill works best in working environments where uncertainty and unpredictability are accepted.
