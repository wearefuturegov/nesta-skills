You understand that the details of an issue are as important as how they fit in the ‘big picture’. You recognise that problems often involve an interconnected mess of small actions in large complex systems, and so considering the relationship between them is crucial. You explore how change at one scale might affect a whole system over time.

Using systems thinking in this way leads to a more holistic view of a complex situation, in which the multiple elements (be that people, processes or structures) are understood in terms of their relation to each other. It also helps identifies how the design of services and intervention points can become a productive part of wider systems change.
