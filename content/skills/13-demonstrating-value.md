You can “sell” an idea by explaining both its value and the evidence that supports it. You do so by creating meaningful messages in whatever format works best for your audience. This grows support, understanding and buy-in to move ideas forward.

You are also able to support the generation of useful data and evidence that sheds new light on an issue, and demonstrate why action should be taken to deal with it differently.
