You understand and use a variety of data sources, whether quantitative or qualitative, to inform and make better sense of your work. This helps you to uncover a more complete picture, and leads to more joined up thinking and deeper insights.

You know that not all answers will come from the same source and by looking across a variety you are more likely to identify insightful patterns. This wide understanding of data underpins the decisions you make.
