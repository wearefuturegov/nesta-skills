You test ideas before you put them into practice, and learn from those tests to create better solutions to a problem. You know how to pick the right method to turn an idea into a hypothesis to test. By recording what you learn (about what works and what doesn’t), you make sure to take these insights into the next, improved version of an idea. You test your assumptions throughout a project and adapt to what you discover.

Prototyping doesn’t deliver a perfect solution right out of the gate. So you see ‘not getting it right first time’ as an opportunity to learn rather than a failure.
