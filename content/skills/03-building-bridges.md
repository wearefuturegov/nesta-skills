By reaching out and making new connections between different groups, you help stakeholders with different interests find common ground and orient them towards a shared goal.

Stakeholders often have different aims around a single issue. Looking beyond these differences, spotting the similarities and aligning them to a common goal is the art of bridge building. That might mean translating the different perspectives and ideas of one group into terms another would understand. This is no doubt hard, but can create the trust necessary to focus on a shared goal.
