Youâ€™re aware that not everyone communicates the same way, and are creative in bringing the best out of people. You use different approaches to fit the people in the room.

Creative facilitation looks different depending on who is doing it, but done well it produces similar outcomes; creative exploration of possibilities and the shared understanding or ownership of ideas. This could be through high energy workshops, meetings, events or conversations.
