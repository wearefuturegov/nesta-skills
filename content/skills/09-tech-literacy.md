You recognise the potential in tech developments, but know that the tech isn’t the ‘innovation’ or necessarily the answer per se, rather a tool to help you get closer to a solution.

You use technology to generate fresh insights and solutions, or to improve existing work in areas like accessibility, democracy, experimentation, data analysis (for example!). Tech literacy can create opportunities to carry out the most up-to-date thinking in problem solving, and being aware of what’s new makes sure organisations aren’t left behind.
