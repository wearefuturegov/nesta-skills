You can recognise differences and manage potential tensions to avoid individual interests dominating collaborative efforts.

This involves identifying the motivations of different groups, and ensuring nobodyâ€™s views are neglected. This skill is particularly useful in situations where there are many contrasting points of view and/or lots of opportunities for misunderstanding!

Successful brokering is often informal. And when successful, it sees a variety of partners working in common cause despite their differences.
