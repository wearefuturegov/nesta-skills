  At States of Change we partner with individuals and institutions to test their
  assumptions, facilitate their learning and act as their guides in our efforts
  to solve public problems. We try to shorten the gap between trying something
  and trying something *better.* See [what we
  do](https://states-of-change.org/what-we-do) to help teams the around the
  world or [talk to us](hello@states-of-change.org) to see how we can support
  your work.

Revealing the skills and attitudes of innovative teams changing the world for good.

## Why we built this

We believe in the power of teams and when the chemistry is right, small groups of people can do amazing things. Our skills and attitudes are the core ingredients of what makes the most innovative teams, innovative, experimental and groundbreaking. We wanted to name and help people excel at them. That’s why we’ve created this beta app, designed to help you unearth your team's strengths and identify areas for collective development.

## Why you should trust us

This experimental site was created by [States of Change](https://states-of-change.org/), a global collective of accomplished public innovators and experienced practitioners. We help large organisations and governments become more experimental, participatory and agile so they can respond to the challenges of our age.

Our recommendations are based on and our own real world experience in government teams the world over, and our exhaustive research creating the [Competency Framework](https://states-of-change.org/resources/competency-framework-for-experimental-problem-solving-1) back in our days at the UK Innovation Foundation, [Nesta](https://www.nesta.org.uk/). A tool tested with and used by countless government agencies, innovation labs and savvy practitioners around the world, from Canada to Colombia. The app itself was designed and built by the awesome team at [FutureGov](https://wearefuturegov.com/).

## Built on solid foundations

We felt something was missing when innovators in government were seen as the people comfortable with creative thinking, sticky notes and brainstorming. Those are a part of the picture. But it didn't capture the full range of competencies and team effort needed to systematically create, authorise, test and improve on ideas. We call those the skills, attitudes and behaviours necessary to solve public problems.
