Revealing the skills and attitudes of innovative teams changing the world for good.

## Why we built this

We believe in the power of teams and when the chemistry is right, small groups of people can do amazing things. Our skills and attitudes are the core ingredients of what makes the most innovative teams, innovative, experimental and groundbreaking. We wanted to name and help people excel at them. That’s why we’ve created this beta app, designed to help you unearth your team's strengths and identify areas for collective development.

## Why you should trust us

This experimental site was created by [States of Change](https://states-of-change.org/), a global collective of accomplished public innovators and experienced practitioners. We work for the public good both inside, and with, governments globally.

Our recommendations are based on our exhaustive research and real world experience in creating the [Competency Framework](https://states-of-change.org/resources/competency-framework-for-experimental-problem-solving-1) back in our days at the innovation foundation, [Nesta](https://www.nesta.org.uk/). A tool tested with and used by countless government agencies, innovation labs and experienced practitioners around the world, from Canada to Colombia. The app itself was designed and built by the awesome team at [FutureGov](https://wearefuturegov.com/).

## Built on solid foundations

The Competency Framework outlining the key skills, attitudes and behaviours that public innovators combine in order to solve public problems. [Explore the framework further](https://states-of-change.org/resources/competency-framework-for-experimental-problem-solving-1).
