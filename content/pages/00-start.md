title: Introducing the skills
top_content: >-
  Our research showed that when teams have skills and behaviours in the
  following three areas, they’re more successful at experimenting and
  problem-solving. They're not perfect, but they're more effective, creative and
  impactful in their work.


  For us, 'experimenting' is a continual process of exploring problems from fresh perspectives, then testing and iterating the possible solutions to learn what works and what doesn’t.


  There are three groups of skills we saw in these teams.
block_one_title: Working together
block_one_content: Engaging with citizens and stakeholders to create shared
  ownership of new solutions.
block_two_title: Leading change
block_two_content: Using your resources and support to make change happen.
block_three_title: Accelerating learning
block_three_content: Exploring and iterating new ideas to inform and test solutions.

  Each of the three areas relates to a specific set of skills and behaviours.


  No individual will have all these! Instead, we suggest you think about how these skills are spread across your team. The exciting opportunity is to combine them in ways that galvanise that group to be greater than the individuals within it.


  Over the next few pages, you'll be asked to select both your strongest and least strong skills and attitudes. We'll use your answers to suggest roles you're more likely to play in a team as well as ways to develop your skills.
