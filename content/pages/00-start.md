  Our research has shown that when teams have skills and behaviours in the following three areas, they’re more likely to be successful at experimenting and problem solving. This means they are more effective, efficient and impactful in their work.


  For us, experimenting means a continual process of exploring problems from new perspectives, and testing and iterating possible solutions to learn what works and what doesn’t.

  Each of the three areas relates to a specific set of skills and behaviours.


  We wouldn’t expect for one individual to have all these. Instead, they should be spread across a wider team. The challenge (and opportunity) is to combine them in ways that make the team greater than its individual members.


  You as an individual might still have a range of these skills (at varying degrees of strength) across all three areas. Or you may naturally gravitate to only one or two of them.


  Over the next few pages, you'll be asked to select both your strongest and least strong skills and attitudes. From this, we'll show you the roles you're most likely to play in a team as well as how you can develop each skill.
