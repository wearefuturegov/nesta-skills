      Our research has shown that when teams have skills and behaviours in the following three core areas, they’re more likely to be successful at experimenting and problem solving. This means they are more effective, efficient and impactful in their work.
block_one_title: Working together
block_one_content: Engaging with citizens and stakeholders to create shared ownership of new solutions.
block_two_title: Leading Change
block_two_content: Mobilising resources and support to make change happen.
block_three_title: Accelerating Learning
block_three_content: Exploring and iterating new ideas to inform and validate solutions.

  Each of the three areas relates to a specific set of skills and behaviours.

  We wouldn’t expect for one individual to have all these; instead, they should be spread across a wider team. The challenge (and opportunity) is to combine them in ways that make the team greater than its individual members.

  You as an individual might still have a range of these skills (at varying degrees of strength and weakness) across all three areas. Or you may naturally gravitate to only one or two of them.
