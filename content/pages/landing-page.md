_1_strapline: Skills, attitudes and behaviours that fuel public innovation
_2_paragraph_1: >-
  Welcome to our skills and attitudes tool! This tool will help you reflect on
  and develop the skills you need to innovate in the public sector.


  The app is based on our competency framework, which defines the skills and attitudes teams in the public sector use to experiment and solve complex public problems. 


  We developed the framework with leading innovation practitioners from across the globe. Since then, with our partners [States of Change](https://states-of-change.org/) weâ€™ve tested it with government teams and innovation experts in the UK, Portugal, Colombia, Canada, Australia and more.
