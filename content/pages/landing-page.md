_1_strapline: Skills, attitudes and behaviours that fuel public innovation
_2_paragraph_1: >-
  Innovation in the public sector often focuses on learning new
  methods. These are of course valuable, but we’ve found that on their own they
  are not enough. We also need to understand the core set of attitudes and
  skills that underpin and support these methods.
  

  We developed the Competency Framework through interviews and research with
  leading innovation practitioners from across the globe. Since then, with our
  partners [States of Change](https://states-of-change.org/) we’ve tested it
  with governments and innovation experts from Portugal and Colombia to Canada
  and Australia.
