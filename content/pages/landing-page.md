_1_strapline: Skills, attitudes and behaviours that fuel public innovation
_2_paragraph_1: >-
  Welcome to our skills and attitudes tool. We’ve designed it to help you
  reflect on and develop the skills you (or your team) need to be public
  innovators. 


  The app builds on the solid foundation of [Nesta’s framework outlining the skills and attitudes](https://states-of-change.netlify.app/about) teams in and around the public sector possess to experiment and solve complex public problems.


  That framework has been tested with the States of Change fellows, practitioners from across the globe and with government teams and innovation experts in the UK, Portugal, Colombia, Canada, Australia and more.


  So, let’s begin. This tool should take around 10 minutes to complete.
