title_3: What to do now
body_3: >-
  You've identified your skills and attitudes, plus the roles they align with.
  Now let's put it to action.


  Here are some ways to get the best from your results.
title_4: Run a team session
body_4: Individuals - like you - are important. But teams can be truly special.
  Find out how to run an activity with your team to develop a picture of all
  your skills as a whole. An excellent reflective exercise and great success
  with both new teams and old ones.
title_5: Develop your skills
body_5: We have created a list of resources that will help you develop your
  skills and take them to the next level. We suggest you focus on what's strong
  rather than what's wrong and build on what you are already good at. Time to
  excel.
title_6: Why trust any of this?
body_6: >-
  Our recommendations are based on our exhaustive research and real world
  experience in creating the Competency Framework and its accompanying guide.


  The Competency Framework visualises the skills and attitudes of innovative teams working in the public good. The practice guide explores in greater depth what those skills are as well as the behaviours that bring them to life. Use them. Explore them. See what resonates and takes your team up a level.
title_7: We can help
body_7: >-
  This experimental site was created by [States of
  Change](https://states-of-change.org/), a global collective of expert public
  innovators and experienced practitioners. We work for the public good both
  inside, and with, governments globally.


  We help teams adapt to the uncertain world we all work in and hone the skills they need to face the grand challenges of our age. If that sounds like something you're doing and you could do with support, email us at [hello@states-of-change.org](mailto:hello@states-of-change.org.) and let's see how we can be of service.

There are 9 roles we've found across innovative teams. We've picked the ones below that we think you are best suited for, based on what you told us.

You might recognise a role here that you already do, other people find areas they hadnâ€™t thought of before; their *untapped potential*. Explore the roles and see where they might show up in what you do now, and if they don't? Think about where they might be able to.
