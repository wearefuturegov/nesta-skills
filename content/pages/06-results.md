  Our recommendations are based on our exhaustive research and real world
  experience in creating the Competency Framework and its accompanying guide.


  The Competency Framework visualises the skills and attitudes of innovative teams working in the public good. The practice guide explores in greater depth what those skills are as well as the behaviours that bring them to life. Use them. Explore them. See what resonates and takes your team up a level.

body_7: >-
  This experimental site was created by [States of
  Change](https://states-of-change.org/), a global collective of expert public
  innovators and experienced practitioners. We work for the public good both
  inside, and with, governments globally.


  We help teams adapt to the uncertain world we all work in and hone the skills they need to face the grand challenges of our age. If that sounds like something you're doing and you could do with support, email us at [hello@states-of-change.org](mailto:hello@states-of-change.org.) and let's see how we can be of service.
