title_3: What to do now
body_3: >-
  You've identified your skills and attitudes, plus the roles they align with.
  Now let's put it into action.


  Here are some ways to get the best from your results.
title_4: Run a team session
body_4: Individuals - like you - are important. But teams can be truly special.
  Find out how to run an activity with your team to develop a picture of all
  your skills as a whole. An excellent reflective exercise and great success
  with both new teams and old ones.
title_5: Develop your skills
body_5: We have created a list of resources that will help you develop your
  skills and take them to the next level. We suggest you focus on what's strong
  rather than what's wrong and build on what you are already good at. Time to
  excel.
title_6: Why you can trust this
body_6: >-
  Our recommendations are based on exhaustive research and real world experience
  in creating the Competency Framework and its accompanying guide back in our
  days at the innovation foundation,
  [Nesta](https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/what-are-skills-and-attitudes-successful-public-problem-solving/).
  A tool tested with and used by countless government agencies, innovation labs
  and experienced practitioners around the world, from Canada to Colombia. 


  The Competency Framework visualises the skills and attitudes of innovative teams working in the public good. The practice guide explores in greater depth what those skills are as well as the behaviours that bring them to life. Use them. Explore them. See what resonates and takes your team up a level.
title_7: Who built this
body_7: >-
  This experimental site was created by [States of
  Change](https://states-of-change.org/), a not-for-profit of accomplished
  public innovators and experienced practitioners. We help large organisations
  and governments become more experimental, participatory and agile so they can
  respond to the challenges of our age. 


  If that sounds like something you're doing and you could do with support, see [what we do](https://states-of-change.org/what-we-do) or email us at [hello@states-of-change.org](mailto:hello@states-of-change.org.) and let's see how we can help.

We've picked the roles below that we think you are best suited for, based on what you told us.

You might recognise a role here that you already do, other people find areas they hadnâ€™t thought of before; their *untapped potential*. Explore the roles and see where they might show up in what you do now, and if they don't? Think about where they might be able to.
